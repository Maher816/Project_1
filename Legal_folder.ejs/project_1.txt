using javascript, html, tailwind and some other frameworks if needed, a database (maybe 2) and python

create a website using the jscript I learned from seneca and catch up on the remaining recordings needed

create a game from the 100 days python tutorial




with jscript create a website about the games from python,
have some cool effects to learn more??
make the page look nice and appropriate
	add main page, done
	login page, 
	create account page,
	a code that redirects a user if not logged in,
	smth for the game player if needed, use blackjack
	add a leader board so users can compete (this will need the database)

	a way for jscript to communicate with python to recieve player points (if the game does track points)
	may need to create that myself

with python
	create a game,
	I have blackjack to use

	find out how to make it multiplayer (optional),
	,

html
	create an appealing page i gues :p
	account page
	idk for this honestly

database
	when user creates an account, their info (username and password) will be created and stored in here,
	when user inputs their info (username and password) a code must check if the given username and 
	password match the stored username and it's respective password if one or both are incorrect refuse 
	login attempt,
	should also be used to store points the user earned and must be displayed on the leader board for other
	users to see


what is needed
	a home page greeting the user
		in the home page, it should prompt the user to either create or login if it detects that the user is not logged in.
		when the user is logged in have the page display different data, basically greetings <username>
		and have the python player visible if possible

	an about page talking about it's creator (me) and some other related things

	a profile page that displays the relavent info for each respective user
		a delete account button.
	
	a page that shows every other existing user
		also allows you to search for specific users by username

	a page denying access if user is not logged in
		probably needs await and then catch blocks

user and users
	will need to change stuff in user
	users will display the existing user in non json format
	each user will have a link you can click to view their profile
		if a user has their private value to 1 (True) their info is hi
